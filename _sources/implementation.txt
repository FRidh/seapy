The previous chapter explained what Statistical Energy Analysis is. 
In this chapter we will have a closer look on how SEA is implemented.

=========
Overview
=========

An SEA model in SeaPy is represented by the descendents of the following abstract objects:

* :class:`seapy.components.Component.Component`
* :class:`seapy.subsystems.Subsystem.Subsystem`
* :class:`seapy.connections.Connection.Connection`
* :class:`seapy.couplings.Coupling.Coupling`
* :class:`seapy.materials.Material.Material`
* :class:`seapy.excitations.Excitation.Excitation`

as well as the main class representing the model

* :class:`seapy.system.System.System`

The following figure gives an overview on how the classes are related.

      Subsystem -> Component -> System;
      Coupling -> Connection -> System;
      Connection -> Component
      Coupling -> Subsystem
      Coupling -> Component
      Component -> Material -> System
      Excitation -> Subsystem
    }
    
Components can have multiple subsystems. Depending on the type of component these are added automatically when creating a component.
If components are connected to eachother a connection needs to be created. The connection will automatically create all possible couplings between the subsystems.
